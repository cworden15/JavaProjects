The files in the respo contain a few java programs I created during my time at U of A. Overall, these projects are a demonstration of OOP concepts such as classes and objects and abstraction. 

SRC files-
    The SRC file contains a collection of classes that aim to replicate spotify. This project was designed to show how classes and objects interact. For example, the playlist object has a constructor that contains a list of songs. The library is a set of songs and so forth. 
    These collections also illustrate my knowledge of getters and setters, interactions of private and public methods and so on. 

Patient Queue- 
    The main goal of the patient queue program is to demonstrate abstraction in java/computer science. The patient queue is a low priority que built on the built-in java array. 

Recursion- 
    This file contains problems solved by recursion. 

QuadTree- 
    This file contains code for a quadtree. I am not certain that this is the final version of this project. This program will not run. This is to show the modularity of the quadtree along with the search functions.
